                    core technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's essential to set a goal that pushes you to
                    not only understand these technologies but also to stay abreast of the latest frameworks and tools.
                    This continuous learning is vital in a field that is constantly changing, ensuring that your skills
